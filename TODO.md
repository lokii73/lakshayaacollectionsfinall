# TODO: Show Cart and Register Tab

## Steps to Complete

1. **Edit src/App.tsx**: Add cart and register links to the `navItems` array in the `NavBar` component. Include appropriate icons (ShoppingBag for cart, User for register) and ensure the cart shows a badge if items are present using the `useCart` hook.
2. **Test the Changes**: Run the development server and verify that the cart and register tabs are visible and functional in the main navigation.
